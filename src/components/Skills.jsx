            <p>
                My professional experience encompasses AI-based image processing and analysis software, including OpenCV applications, OCR systems, GAN and Transformer-based image enhancement (Super Resolution), segmentation, object detection and tracking, and dataset labeling.
            </p>
                I have also worked on real-time AI systems, such as quality control software, face recognition and identification systems, and high-voltage line fault detection projects, often leveraging PyTorch models and inference systems like Triton and Torch-Serve.
            <p>
                In the field of natural language processing (NLP) and Transformer architectures, I have developed various applications, while in remote sensing and GIS, I have analyzed and processed satellite imagery.
            </p>
                Additionally, I have experience in web and system technologies, including web interface applications (ASP.NET Core), microservice architectures, virtualization (Docker/Kubernetes/Proxmox), CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Workflow, GHCR, ArgoCD, Ansible), and monitoring systems (Prometheus & Grafana).
            <p>
                I have also conducted specialized research projects, such as tennis player performance analysis and ITN testing, and AI model training on Huawei Atlas 800 servers with NPU acceleration.
