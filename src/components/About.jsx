      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
          My passion for image processing and artificial intelligence has driven me to conduct intensive research in these fields and develop various projects.
          As a Forensic Informatics Engineer, I began exploring artificial intelligence in areas closely related to my interests, such as facial recognition, fingerprint recognition, fingerprint enhancement, iris recognition, signature verification, and EEG-based lie detection. Over time, I expanded my work to include object detection, object tracking, segmentation applications, posture analysis, and remote sensing (satellite imagery).
          Through the projects I worked on, I gained significant experience using advanced technologies such as web applications (C#), virtualization architectures (Docker, Kubernetes), real-time streaming systems (Confluent Kafka, Redis, RTMP), and communication protocols (REST/gRPC).
          Driven by the desire to translate my AI knowledge into practical applications and contribute to national projects, I actively strive to bring every opportunity I encounter to fruition.
